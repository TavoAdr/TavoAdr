### 👨🏽‍💻 Who Am I?

Hi 👋, my name is Gustavo, but for practicality, you can call me Tavo. I am a **student of computer engineering** and an novice programmer, but I am proud to say that in the midst of so many hobbies that I started and stopped in the middle, I want programming to be one of the few that I continued.

**🛠️ Tool**

To program, I'm more used to using  ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=plastic&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white), but I've been through several IDEs and text editors, even ![VIM](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-019733?style=plastic&logo=vim&logoColor=white).

As for the operating system, I currently use ![Pop! os](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pop!_os-48B9C7?style=plastic&logo=pop_os&logoColor=white) for having several resources that make me more productive, but I have used several others, such as Windows, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary, Zorin os, among many others.

My personal and project organization is almost entirely based on the use of the ![Notion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-000000?style=plastic&logo=notion&logoColor=white) application, and my own method of organization based on **GTD**.
