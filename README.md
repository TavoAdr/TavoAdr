- 👋 Hi, I’m @TavoAdr
- 👀 I’m interested in learn more and more about programming and automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some languages like C, like C ++, Java, in addition to python for having a very clean structure and shell to create scripts for my Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, mainly focused on linux or browser that allow greater productivity during its use.
- 📫 How to find me? That's a good question, but I still don't know the answer. Maybe I will add an email in the near future.
