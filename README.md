## 😁 ABOUT ME

### 👨🏽‍💻 Who Am I?

Hi 👋, my name is Gustavo, but for practicality, you can call me Tavo. I am a **student of computer engineering** and an aspiring programmer, but I am proud to say that in the midst of so many hobbies that I started and stopped in the middle, I want programming to be one of the few that I continued.

### What do I Like to do In My Spare Time?

- 📚 Learning new things on your own.
- 🎯 Organization and personal planning.
- 📼 Watch series in the original language (mainly English and Spanish).
- 🍂 Discover new places around the world.

**🛠️ Tool**

To program, I'm more used to using **Visual Studio Code**, but I've been through several IDEs and text editors, even Vim.

As for the operating system, I currently use **Pop! os** for having several resources that make me more productive, but I have used several others, such as Windows, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary, Zorin os, among many others.

My personal and project organization is almost entirely based on the use of the **notion** application, and my own method of organization based on GTD.
